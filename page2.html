        <p>
            Fashion trends have evolved over time and still have an impact on how 
            individuals express themselves. Every year, the fashion industry is 
            dominated by new patterns, trends, and designs that influence more than
            just clothing but also culture. Trends like athleisure, which combines 
            comfort and style to make people feel both stylish and practical, have 
            been seen in the past. The fashion industry has long adopted the 
            oversized design, which started with coats and blazers and offers a 
            stylish but relaxed vibe. Once seen as obscure, streetwear has grown to 
            have a significant impact on mainstream fashion, with labels like 
            Supreme and Off-White establishing the standard for urban style.
    
            Going even further back in time, fashion movements such as the grunge 
            wave of the 1990s popularized plaid shirts, torn jeans, and combat boots,
            which represented a rebellious and careless attitude. Low-rise jeans 
            with bold colors that conveyed a positive, youthful energy became 
            popular in the early 2000s. Retro fashion has had a comeback in recent
            years, with many contemporary designs drawing inspiration from the 
            1970s and 1980s. As part of this nostalgic renaissance,
            chunky sneakers, tie-dye designs, and flared jeans have also all seen 
            a return in these last few years.
    
            Today, fashion trends are as diversie in my opinion. people blend styles 
            from various eras to create their own unique looks. Sustainability is becoming 
            more important in the industry, with more people opting for eco-friendly 
            fabrics and vintage clothing as part of the "slow fashion" movement. 
            The continuous evolution of fashion proves that it's not just about following 
            trends, but also about self-expression, individuality, and creativity.
