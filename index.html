    <h1>Pierre's Website</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p> Hi! My name is Pierre and I am currently a 
        Sophomore at Northeastern University studying Data Science 
        and Business. I was born and grew up in France 
        for about 11 years until I came to the United States. 
        In my free time, I love to cook, bake, listen and discover 
        new music. One of my favorite foods to cook at the moment is 
        japanese curry. Since it's getting colder in Boston, this curry 
        is so delicious and keeps me warm after a long busy day. Another 
        hobby I've started picking up in Boston is biking. With Boston's 
        blue bikes system, I've been getting my cardio in every other day 
        just through biking around the city. From getting groceries, going 
        to friends, and getting food, biking around the city has helped me 
        discover beautiful places in Boston that I would've never came across 
        otherwise.

    <h3>My Journey with Fashion</h3>

    <p>Over the years, discovering my own style has not only been a 
        fun journey but it has also given me a lot of confidence. 
        Dressing up in clothes that reflect who I am has become an enjoyable 
        part of my routine. I've found that when I feel comfortable and confident 
        in what I'm wearing, my day becomes more productive and enjoyable. 
        Whether it's choosing bolder patterns, unqiue jewelries, or going for a 
        more minimalist look, the act of putting together outfits 
        that match my mood never fails to bring me a sense of fulfillment. 
        Fashion has bridged many oppurtunities and friendships that would've 
        never happened otherwise!
    </p>
